Here we are interested in a generalization of the Steiner problem, which entails finding a graph minimizing a cost function associated with connecting a given set of points. In this paper, we concentrate on a specific formulation of this problem which is applied to the generation of synthetic vascular trees. More precisely, we focus on the Constrained Constructive Optimization (CCO) tree algorithm, which constructs a vascular network iteratively, optimizing a blood transport energy efficiency. We show that the classical incremental construction method often leads to sub-optimal results, and that a better global solution can be reached.\nLinks # Paper ","date":"5 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/papers/dgmm24/","section":"Papers","summary":"Authors : # Raoul Sallé de Chou(1,2), Mohamed Ali Srir(1) , Laurent Najman(3) , Nicolas Passat(4) , Hugues Talbot (5,3) , Irène Vignon-Clementel(1)","title":"Convex optimization for binary tree-based transport networks (DGMM24)","type":"papers"},{"content":"","date":"5 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/dgmm24/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"DGMM24","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"5 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/gnn/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"GNN","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"5 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/graph-optimization/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Graph Optimization","type":"tags"},{"content":" Under Review # ","date":"5 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/papers/inria-internship/","section":"Papers","summary":"Paper currently under Review","title":"INRIA Internship Paper","type":"papers"},{"content":" Master student passionate about AI and multimodality, I love playing with different data structures especially images, graphs, meshes and recently NeRFs and Gaussian Splatting.

You can find a formal CV here.\nThe story # Before starting my academic journey, I was a random lost guy (metlouf), who loved Linux, interested in programmation, and invested a lot of times making memes and some editing in Gimp. I wanted to be an engineer in Computer science, because it is the closest thing I knew to make a living out of Linux and learning more programmation and why not make scripts and contribute to opensource and flex in Reddit. Moulay Youssef Preparatory Classes sept 2019 - july 2021 Rabat, Morocco My journey started in Rabat, at Moulay Youssef Preparatory Classes a two-year intensive program in Mathematics and Physics designed to prepare students for admission to French Grande école.\nAt this time, I was happy mission almost complete let's go throught the 3 years and I will be there ! I will become a computer science engineer ... Télécom Paris sept 2021 - july 2023 Saclay, France I then integrated Télécom Paris, which, despite its name, is actually not in Paris but in the suburbs in Saclay, or the so-called European Silicon Valley. Here, I learned a lot of things I always wanted to learn, and more importantly, I discovered two things that I never thought of doing before: Computer Vision and Research.\nThis 2 first year changed a lot of things on how I see my future and what my dreams are. I still wanted to do computer science, but in a different way, in a 'mathier' way because I realized I like math and I need to be better in Math. I really loved how important my professors are, not only as educators but also as researchers. I found out, for example, that my statistics teacher was actually contributing to a lot of open-source software and databases, and I wanted to know more about this world of research. So I took a Gap Year, to be a Research Intern, and take some time before my master. INRIA july 2023 - jan 2024 Saclay, France My first research experience was with the SimbiotX team, where I was supervised by Raoul Sallé de Chou and Irène Vignon-Clémentel. We worked on a collaborative project between Simbiotx (Saclay, FR) and Heartflow (Mountain View, CA), focusing on vessel tree extension and perfusion simulation. This was the first time I coded something meaningful. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t just a script for personal use or a school project; it was research, involving AI and addressing heart disease detection. I found myself working with people\u0026rsquo;s hearts (well, meshes from CT scans on a computer, not actual blood, but it was heartening). The goal of my work was to replace a perfusion physics simulation (how blood circulates into the heart) with a Graph Neural Network that performs the same task but is more robust in low-quality scenarios, first time first author paper. I also participated in one of Raoul\u0026rsquo;s projects on Vascular Tree generation, where I fell in love with optimization and discovered the importance of testing code and visualizing results (shoutout to the ComputX team). I also learned a lot about the human aspect of research, the importance of networking, and why people move around so much. I also had the chance to work with the Heartflow team in London with Matthew Sinclair and in Palo Alto with Sabrina Lynch, both from magical Palaiseau. We worked in the beautiful Turing Building with the red sculpture. I am very grateful to all the people who took the time to explain things to me, from finite elements to uncertainty quantification, good coding practices, and reproducible research. We also had many discussions about what research entails, the world of publication, the roles of public and private actors, and life in general. I really love you all, couldn\u0026rsquo;t dream of a better start.\n(s/o Charles, s/o Peter, s/o Pavlito, s/o My strong neighbour Yassine, s/o Ihsane, s/o Jérôme, s/o Mahdi, s/o Jirka, s/o Jules, s/o Ana, s/o Ramdane, s/o Kevin, s/o Roel, s/o Dirk)\nHome jan 2024 - mar 2024 Saclay, France I had two months free, looked for a second internship out of Paris in 3D video games/VFX industry, wrote my first paper, and read/watched a looooot of One Piece (incredible piece of litterature). Unoffically still going to INRIA.\nInterDigital mar 2024 - aug 2024 Rennes, France Just started an internship at InterDigital on 3D Avatar Reconstruction, under the guidance of João Regateiro and François Le Clerc. We\u0026rsquo;re delving into novel 3D reconstruction methods, specifically NeRF and Gaussian Splatting, and their applications in face reconstruction and animation. I\u0026rsquo;ve had the pleasure of testing the Apple Vision Pro (I\u0026rsquo;ll proudly tell my kids I was there from day one). Our discussions also touch on the ethics of such work and the risks associated with potential misuse, particularly concerning faces (DeepFakes are fascinating in research but less so on Twitter). I am also very happy to use Blender in my daily life, started by the donut tutorial in High School without Discrete GPU, now we here !\nFuture sept 2024 - future Somwhere Where are we going brother, where are we going ?\n","date":"5 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/journey/","section":"Intro","summary":"Intro # In this page, I want a talk about my journey, note that I am cherry-picking information, I am mostly talking about things I succeeded in but it is important to know that I failed in a lot of things (I may make a CV of failure as I saw in another website, someday).","title":"My journey","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"5 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/paper/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Paper","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"5 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/papers/","section":"Papers","summary":"","title":"Papers","type":"papers"},{"content":"","date":"5 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":" Coming Soon # ","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"","summary":" Coming Soon # ","title":"","type":"posts"}]

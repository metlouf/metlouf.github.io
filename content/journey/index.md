## Intro
In this page, I want a talk about my journey, note that I am cherry-picking information, I am mostly talking about things I 
succeeded in but it is important to know that I failed in a lot of things (I may make a CV of failure as I saw in another website, someday).
You can find a formal CV [here](CV_SRIR.pdf).

## The story

{{< timeline >}}
Before starting my academic journey, I was a random lost guy (metlouf), who loved Linux, interested in programmation, and invested a lot of times making memes and some editing in Gimp. I wanted to be an engineer in Computer science, because it is the closest thing I knew to make a living out of Linux and learning more programmation and why not make scripts and contribute to opensource and flex in Reddit.

My journey started in Rabat, at [Moulay Youssef Preparatory Classes](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UTxPwVss6pCM3RBy6) a two-year intensive program in Mathematics and Physics designed to prepare students for admission to French [Grande école](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grande_%C3%A9cole).

At this time, I was happy mission almost complete let's go throught the 3 years and I will be there ! I will become a computer science engineer ...

I then integrated [Télécom Paris](http://www.telecom-paris.fr/), which, despite its name, is actually not in Paris but in the suburbs in Saclay, or the so-called [European Silicon Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plateau_de_Saclay). Here, I learned a lot of things I always wanted to learn, and more importantly, I discovered two things that I never thought of doing before: Computer Vision and Research.

This 2 first year changed a lot of things on how I see my future and what my dreams are. I still wanted to do computer science, but in a different way, in a 'mathier' way because I realized I like math and I need to be better in Math. I really loved how important my professors are, not only as educators but also as researchers. I found out, for example, that my <a href = https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/bonald/Home_page.html>statistics teacher</a> was actually contributing to a lot of open-source software and databases, and I wanted to know more about this world of research. So I took a Gap Year, to be a Research Intern, and take some time before my master.

My first research experience was with the [SimbiotX team](https://team.inria.fr/simbiotx/), where I was supervised by Raoul Sallé de Chou and [Irène Vignon-Clémentel](https://team.inria.fr/simbiotx/team-members/irene-vignon-clementel/). We worked on a collaborative project between Simbiotx (Saclay, FR) and Heartflow (Mountain View, CA), focusing on vessel tree extension and perfusion simulation. This was the first time I coded something meaningful. It wasn't just a script for personal use or a school project; it was research, involving AI and addressing heart disease detection. I found myself working with people's hearts (well, meshes from CT scans on a computer, not actual blood, but it was heartening). The goal of my work was to replace a perfusion physics simulation (how blood circulates into the heart) with a Graph Neural Network that performs the same task but is more robust in low-quality scenarios,[first time first author paper](../papers/inria-internship). I also participated in one of Raoul's projects on [Vascular Tree generation](../papers/dgmm24), where I fell in love with optimization and discovered the importance of testing code and visualizing results (shoutout to the ComputX team). I also learned a lot about the human aspect of research, the importance of networking, and why people move around so much. I also had the chance to work with the Heartflow team in London with Matthew Sinclair and in Palo Alto with Sabrina Lynch, both from magical Palaiseau. We worked in the beautiful Turing Building [with the red sculpture](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2tFc9jsLkSBesiLP6). I am very grateful to all the people who took the time to explain things to me, from finite elements to uncertainty quantification, good coding practices, and reproducible research. We also had many discussions about what research entails, the world of publication, the roles of public and private actors, and life in general. I really love you all, couldn't dream of a better start.

I had two months free, looked for a second internship out of Paris in 3D video games/VFX industry, wrote my [first paper](../papers/inria-internship), and read/watched a looooot of One Piece (incredible piece of litterature). Unoffically still going to INRIA.

Just started an internship at [InterDigital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterDigital) on 3D Avatar Reconstruction, under the guidance of [João Regateiro](https://joaoregateiro.github.io/) and François Le Clerc. We're delving into novel 3D reconstruction methods, specifically [NeRF](https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf) and [Gaussian Splatting](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/), and their applications in face reconstruction and animation. I've had the pleasure of testing the Apple Vision Pro (I'll proudly tell my kids I was there from day one). Our discussions also touch on the ethics of such work and the risks associated with potential misuse, particularly concerning faces (DeepFakes are fascinating in research but less so on Twitter). I am also very happy to use [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) in my daily life, started by [the donut tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIoXOplUvAw) in High School without Discrete GPU, now we here ! It is also a company doing research and patent and the dynamics are very different than academic research.
